- read ULSAH until start of p. 432
  + under section _8.2 The Linux /etc/shadow file_
- still on SICP ex 1.12


November 21, 2017
-----------------

- read ULSAH until start of p. 446
  + under section _Configuring roles and administrative privileges_
- finally made progress again on Pascal’s triangle through using `cons` on the `else case` of the
  function body instead of an explicit `list` to avoid output confusion

November 23, 2017
-----------------

- read ULSAH until start of p. 457
  + under section _Risk Reduction with PAM_
- still on SICP 1.12
  + problem with how to append the tail 1 to a non-two input to function (what happens
    currently is after the sum of the two numbers above it, it will immediately proceed to the next
    recursive process without appending the tail 1, first)
  + problem on how to deal with “more-than-3” “inside” numbers (because having 1 “inside” number is
    simply the addition of the previous iteration’s values)


November 24, 2017
-----------------

- read ULSAH until p. 478
  + under mini-section _Networking_ of _Cloud Computing_
- SICP 1.12
  + problem from November 23, 2017 still persists (but result now has a more consistent output
    (first two digits of each level of the PT is shown for sure))
